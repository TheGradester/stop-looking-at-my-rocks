Lets start codin coders


"""Michaela's Feedback:

1. make sure you put comments on all your code! comments on the login code look great and make it easy to follow
2. I put some specific feedback on the folder of your app containing all the javascript/android functionality - please check that out. we want to start by perfecting the computer app before extending it to mobile capacities.
3. please put names on each section so i can see who worked on what
4. don't forget to upload your newest work!
