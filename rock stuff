Michaela's feedback:
1. On your activity diagram, please include details on what your feed will look like/what attributes of each rock you are looking at
2. You need a lot more information on your to do list:
  - items under user interface should be their own items - creating a user interface is its own task
  - one task should be to create the structure of what one entry will be
  - one task should be to create the database of entries
  - networking is a big task - add more info here
  - assign specific people to specific tasks!
