Not sure what is going on here.
My primary feedback item is to build the app as a computer app before even attempting to develop an Android app in Java - you guys can definitely do it, but it does require understanding an entirely new framework and language. Let's start with getting the basics of the app down.

What is the plan for networking/user interface?
